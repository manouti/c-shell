0. Brief Overview
------------------

Guolice is a language that allows specification of GUI behaviors. The language allows simple
entities such as strings, simple geometric shapes (boxes, triangles, circles), events (click, key press).
It allows positional operators such as left of, right of, above, and below. It allows shape operations
such as equal, smaller than, bigger than, and contains.
Later on, the language can introduce a conditional structure where a behavior depends on the
current shapes and events. It also can introduce a recursive structure where shapes are defined in
terms of smaller shapes or behaviors are defined in terms of earlier or later behaviors.
Guolice specifies the behavior of a GUI application and facilitates testing it later on. Testing
GUI currently is a painful behavior and involves manual record and replay testing where even a
small change in the resolution of a screen can render a test suite obsolete. With Guolice and a
proper checker that checks whether a trace of a GUI execution violates a Guolice specification, GUI
testing should become much easier.


----------------------------
1. Project Phase 1 (Task 1)
----------------------------

The first phase consisted of writing the grammar of Guolice using the well-known language recognizer generation tool Antlr (wwwa.antlr.org).
As in the case of any language, the grammar is composed of two sets of rules: lexer and parser rules. Lexer rules define the small tokens
of the language such as integer, a string, or an identifier, and thus is merely a few number of rules that the lexer detects. After tokenizing
the input character stream, the output of the lexer is fed to the parser which figures out how a sequence of tokens forms a grammatically valid
parser rule such as statement, which can be an assignment or a variable declaration. At the end of this phase, we were able to test a number of cases
that apply the rule of Guolice's syntax and thus come up with a simple language that is mostly based on conventional high-level languages like C++, while
adding some syntactic sugar to it. Also emphasizes in this phase was the need to hold the representation of the parse tree of a sample program in a special
data structure. This work was not yet finished.

-----------------------------------
2. Project Phase 2 (Tasks 2 and 3)
-----------------------------------

After building the grammar, we applied some aspect-oriented programming to it by implementing an aspect that, whenever called would
create nodes that represent various parse elements in the program and displays them at the end using a nice graphical format. This way,
we separated the main logic of the program from the graphical aspect. Then we added some inline documentation using the Doxygen (www.doxygen.org; it may
redirect to http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/), and this makes it easy to keep documentation attached to the code. Later, we had an important step
in testing the so far obtained language with various cases, and several bugs appeared which required attention.

We used aspect in order to add functionality around code we had already writen. Our aim was to procude a graph, in dot format.
We used aspect for three fuctions, traverse, visitNode and visitEdge.
*Traverse is a recursive function, with out the aspect. We did tjp->proceed to let it finish created a dot file put the dot file in it. The dot stucture was created and saved while traversing
*visitNode: when a node is visisted there is a check to see if it is a new or reccurent node, if it is new a variable id and color is saved for it, if it is old its color is retrieved from a map. Whatever nessesary dot output is generated and saved. 
*visitEdge: create and edge in dot format.

3. Project Phase 3 (Tasks 4, 5 and 6)
--------------------------------------
Task 4 consisted of restructuring the project directories to reflect a conventional release model. In this way, you will find all source code in the /src
folder, while all other third-party libraries and other resources found in the /third folder. Another example is the /lib folder which we used to learn
how to generated a static and a shared library file in order to present binaries as a plugin for others. Several makefiles were added, one in the top-level
directory that can be used against different phony targets, or to build everything from scratch. Other makefiles do specific jobs like generating doc in the
/doc folder and generating static libraries in /lib.
Task 5 is about translating 
To do translation we used the factory design patern. 
To translate from GuoliceNode --> Standard Node defined in graph.h:
1) traversed the graph 
2) when met Node 
	-checked type( VAR, OP, LITERAL)
	-created coresponding Node
3) when met Edge
	-created standard graph
*traversal using methods in graph.h is used for verification


To translate from a standardNode -> Guolice Graph
1) traversed graph using visitor function
2) in visistor fuctions overwrote the (Node) and (Edge)
	-when visit is called on a Node and it is not already created, it is created
	-when visit is called on an edge, and the second node it is connected to has not yet been created, it is created
*Guolice Traversal is used to verify
